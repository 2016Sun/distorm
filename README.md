Powerful Disassembler Library For x86/AMD64

Welcome to the diStorm3 binary stream disassembler library project!
<i>No more parsing strings! - diStorm3 is really a decomposer, which means it takes an instruction and returns a binary structure which describes it rather than static text, this is great for advanced binary code analysis.</i>
###<font color="blue">diStorm3.3 is now available for <i>commercial</i> use [http://ragestorm.net/distorm/ here].</font>###
"We benchmarked five popular open-source disassembly libraries and chose diStorm3, which had the best performance (and furthermore, has complete 64-bit support).", July 2014, Quoting David Williams-King in his Thesis about Binary Shuffling.
